The project focused on preparing and optimizing data to represent it accurately without bias. The initial step involved removing incomplete data and duplicates to ensure data quality. Then, various optimization techniques were applied, including parameter tuning and normalization and non-normalization methods, to provide a diverse set of conditions for the algorithms. To achieve the best possible results, several machine learning algorithms were designed and implemented, including k-nearest neighbors, weighted k-nearest neighbors, decision trees, and random forests.
